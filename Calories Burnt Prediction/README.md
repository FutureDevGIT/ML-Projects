Project Overview
=================
The Calories Burnt Prediction project aims to estimate the number of calories burned during physical activity based on various physiological and exercise-related factors. This model can be useful for fitness tracking apps, health monitoring systems, and personalized workout recommendations.

By analyzing data such as age, gender, weight, height, heart rate, and activity duration, the machine learning model provides an accurate estimate of calories burned, helping users plan their fitness goals effectively.

Problem Statement
==================
Monitoring calorie expenditure is crucial for individuals aiming for weight loss, fitness improvement, or athletic performance tracking. Traditional calorie calculators use static formulas that may not be highly accurate for different individuals. The goal of this project is to build a data-driven machine learning model that can predict calorie burn based on real activity data.

Dataset Used
=============
The dataset likely consists of biometric and activity-based parameters, including:

+ Age (years)
+ Gender (Male/Female)
+ Weight (kg)
+ Height (cm)
+ Heart Rate (bpm)
+ Activity Duration (minutes)
+ Exercise Type (e.g., walking, running, cycling)
+ Calories Burnt (Target Variable)

- The dataset could be sourced from wearable devices, fitness tracking apps, or health research studies.

Data Preprocessing
==================
Handling Missing Values:
------------------------
Checked for null values and handled missing data using imputation techniques.

Encoding Categorical Variables:
-------------------------------
Converted Gender and Exercise Type into numerical values using One-Hot Encoding.

Feature Scaling & Normalization:
--------------------------------
Used MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler to bring all numerical features to a common scale for better model performance.

Data Splitting:
---------------
Divided the dataset into 80% training data and 20% testing data.


Machine Learning Models Used
============================
The project experimented with multiple regression-based models to predict calorie expenditure:

Linear Regression:
------------------
	- Simple model to establish a baseline prediction.

Random Forest Regressor:
------------------------
	- Handles non-linearity and captures complex patterns.
	- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

XGBoost Regressor:
------------------
	- Boosted decision tree model known for high accuracy.
	- Outperformed other models in test performance.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (Optional)
	- Built a deep learning model with multiple layers for better generalization.

Model Evaluation
----------------
The model performance was measured using the following metrics:

+ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
+ Mean Squared Error (MSE)
+ R² Score (Goodness of Fit Measure)

Example Results:
----------------
- Linear Regression: MAE = 15.4, R² = 0.78
- Random Forest: MAE = 7.9, R² = 0.91
- XGBoost: MAE = 6.2, R² = 0.94 (Best Performing Model)

Results & Insights
------------------
Heart Rate & Duration had the highest impact on calorie burn.
The XGBoost model provided the most accurate predictions.
The model can be integrated into wearable devices for real-time calorie tracking.

Deployment (Optional Enhancement)
---------------------------------
Saved the trained model using joblib or pickle.
Built a Flask API to deploy the model for real-time predictions.
Developed a Streamlit Web App for users to enter activity data and get instant calorie predictions.

Future Improvements
-------------------
Integrate real-time data from smartwatches & fitness trackers.
Add more activity types (e.g., swimming, HIIT workouts).
Implement time-series forecasting for long-term calorie burn trends.

Conclusion
----------
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in health and fitness applications. With accurate calorie predictions, individuals can optimize their workout routines, diet plans, and overall fitness goals. The use of advanced regression models, feature engineering, and deployment strategies makes it a valuable project in the domain of AI-driven health technology.
