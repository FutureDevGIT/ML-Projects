Project Overview
================
The SONAR Rock vs. Mine Prediction project is a binary classification task that uses sonar signals to differentiate between rocks and underwater mines. This type of model has real-world applications in naval defense, underwater exploration, and submarine navigation.

By analyzing sonar wave patterns, the model determines whether an object detected underwater is a rock (natural object) or a mine (potential explosive device).

Problem Statement
==================
Detecting underwater mines is crucial for military operations, marine safety, and scientific exploration. Traditional detection methods rely on manual sonar analysis, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.

This project aims to automate and improve underwater object classification using machine learning, reducing human effort and increasing detection accuracy.

Dataset Used
============
The dataset used for this project is the SONAR Dataset, commonly available on UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 208 samples where:

- 60 numerical features represent sonar signal frequencies.
- Each row corresponds to a sonar signal reflected from an object.
- Target Variable:
	"R" → Rock
	"M" → Mine
The dataset captures the way sonar waves bounce off different objects, enabling the model to learn patterns distinguishing rocks from mines.

Data Preprocessing
==================

Handling Missing Values:
------------------------
The dataset was clean, so no missing values were present.

Encoding Categorical Labels:
----------------------------
- Converted "R" and "M" labels into binary values:
	"R" → 0 (Rock)
	"M" → 1 (Mine)

Feature Scaling:
----------------
Used StandardScaler to normalize sonar frequencies for better model performance.

Data Splitting:
---------------
80% training set, 20% test set using train_test_split().


Machine Learning Models Used
============================
Since this is a binary classification problem, multiple models were trained and evaluated:

1.Logistic Regression:
----------------------
Used as a baseline model to establish initial performance.

2.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
----------------------------
Tested different values of K to find the best neighbors for classification.

3.Random Forest Classifier:
---------------------------
Improved accuracy and reduced overfitting by using multiple decision trees.

4.Support Vector Machine (SVM):
-------------------------------
Used RBF kernel to capture complex decision boundaries.

5.XGBoost Classifier (Best Model):
--------------------------------
Provided the highest accuracy and best generalization.


Model Evaluation
================
The performance was assessed using classification metrics:

- Accuracy Score – Measures overall model correctness.
- Precision & Recall – Determines how well the model distinguishes between rocks and mines.
- F1-Score – Balances precision and recall.
- Confusion Matrix – Shows correct vs. incorrect classifications.

Example Results:
----------------
- Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 76%
- KNN (K=5): Accuracy = 81%
- Random Forest: Accuracy = 85%
- XGBoost (Best Model): Accuracy = 89%, F1-Score = 0.88

Results & Insights
------------------
- The XGBoost classifier performed the best, correctly classifying 89% of sonar signals.
- Sonar wave frequency patterns were key in differentiating rocks from mines.
- Feature importance analysis revealed that certain frequency bands contributed more to classification accuracy.

Deployment (Optional Enhancement)
---------------------------------
- Saved the trained model using joblib or pickle.
- Built a Flask API to deploy the model for real-time sonar signal classification.
- Created a Streamlit Web App for users to upload sonar readings and get predictions.

Future Improvements
-------------------
- Collect real-time sonar data for continuous learning.
- Implement deep learning techniques (CNNs or LSTMs) to enhance pattern recognition.
- Integrate the model into autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for real-time mine detection.

Conclusion
==========
This project demonstrates the real-world impact of AI in marine defense and exploration. By leveraging machine learning for sonar analysis, it enhances safety and efficiency in underwater navigation. The structured approach using data preprocessing, multiple classification models, and deployment strategies makes it a highly practical and valuable AI application.
